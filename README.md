# Clustering

*This project was completed as a part of the Advanced Machine Learning elective at the Nueva School (2019). NBA players are classified not by the five traditional positions but by a variety of clustering models. The full project can be found [here](https://jeremydumalig.com/utilizing-ml-clustering-algorithms-to-classify-nba-player-positions/).*
